This repository is the implementation of a rendezvous hash mechanism that is data center and availability zone aware. 

When people learn about Elixir and Erlang, there are a few truly inspiring videos that demonstrate the nature of these technologies, and the power of the BEAM platform. One of these videos is called [The Soul of Erlang and Elixir, by Saša Jurić, GOTO 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE).  

For me, as an engineer who is interested in the resiliency and high availability of distributed systems, the other one is a series of videos by Brian Hunter about Project Waterpark:

- [Waterpark: Distributed Actors vs the Pandemic, by Bryan Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qUfX3XFi_4) (4 years old)
- [Waterpark: Transforming Healthcare with Distributed Actors", by Bryan Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ0CvjAJXz4) (2 years old)
- [Waterpark: Transforming Healthcare with Distributed Actors, by Bryan Hunter, NDC Oslo 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdBm4K-vvt0)

The [most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdBm4K-vvt0) in that series from 2025 provides most context about how workload is distributed and reliably hosted inside their cluster.
