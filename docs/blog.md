When people learn about Elixir and Erlang, in my opinion, there are few videos that demonstrate the nature of these two technologies as well as a couple of YouTube ones. To do: insert video references here. 
One of these videos is called "The Soul of Erlang and Elixir" by Sascha Juric. The other one which inspired and impressed me is a series of videos by Brian Hunter about Project Waterpark.
